    "## Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. The code can be constructed as a systematic code, what does this mean?\n",
    "   \n",
    "       This means that the code will have well defined places for the allocation of the information bits and the parity check bits.\n",
    "       \n",
    "       \n",
    "   2. That the code is linear is an important fact that simplfies the implementation drastically. \n",
    "   \n",
    "       a) What does it mean that a code is linear?\n",
    "       \n",
    "       A linear code is a code which is defined as a linear combination of basis codes.\n",
    "       \n",
    "       b) What is it that becomes easier?\n",
    "       \n",
    "       For example, if we would have to build a table of all possible codes for a K number of information bits in a codeword, this table would contain $2^K$ items. Using linear codes, the number of items would decrease to just $K$ basis codes. All the theory of using the matrixes $G$ and $H$ for encoding and decoding information, is possible if linear codes are used.\n",
    "       \n",
    "       \n",
    "   3. How many errors can the Hamming(7,4) code detect and correct?\n",
    "       \n",
    "       The Hamming(7,4) code can detect errors to which the Hamming distance between the transmitted and received codes is less or equal to 2. It can correct successfully errors with unitary weight.\n",
    "       \n",
    "### Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. Generator Matrix $G$:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   This is the matrix that will generate an $N$ digits codeword from the $K$ information bits given. This is done according to the following transformation:\n",
    "   $$ x=uG $$\n",
    "   Where $x$ is the $N$ bits vector output and $u$ is the $K$ bits vector input\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "   2. Parity Check Matrix $H$:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   This is the matrix used to check if the received codeword $\\hat{x}$ is valid or not. If the transformation $\\hat{x}H^T$ gives the null vector it means that the received codeword is valid.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "   3. Syndrome Vector $s_{synd}$:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   The syndrome vector is symply defined as $s_{synd}=\\hat{x}H^T$. As described in item 2 of this section, this vector is used to check the validity of the received codeword."
