    "    1. What is the purpose of interleavers?\n",
    "    \n",
    "   Interleavers are used in order to decrease the BER of a transmitted message. It tries to distribute a codeword in a large time so that the effect of fading in the channel gets minimized.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2. Why does it _not_ improve the mean BER for uncoded system?\n",
    "    \n",
    "   Because without coding there is no codeword and redundancy to try to find the original codeword. There is no improvement in changing the order of the bits in an uncoded system, the channel will behave the same and the probability of getting one bit wrong is the same. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    3. What is the latency for the block interleaver in Figure 14.26?\n",
    "    \n",
    "   The latency will be $N_{inteleave}D_{interleave}T_B$ since a codeword will take this time to fill the block and be sent.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    4. How long is the distance between two adjacent bits after interleaving?\n",
    "    \n",
    "   Taking figure 14.26 as the example, the first two bits that are represented in the first column will be read after all the bits in the first row be read completely. Therefore, the distance will become $N_{interleave}T_B$, that is the number of columns in the block times the bit duration.\n",

    "## Observation about the functions that perform the interleaving\n",
    "\n",
    "As I am the one who is going to design the system, I can choose the format of the input of this function. I find it easier to see the interleave as a simple transposition of a matrix. The dimensions of the matrix can be chosen as 7x7, this means that it will do the interleaving procedure in blocks of 7 codewords of length 7. That option is justified by the previous use of the Hamming(4,7) coding.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interleave and deinterleave procedures\n",
    "\n",
    "With the help of my code for assignment 2 I built the input matrix $A$ composed of valid codewords generated by the generator matrix used in that assignment. This can be done by just taking any 4 digit binary number as the input of the function encode and getting the output."

It is important to state that, in this case, the transmission of the bits are in the same order as they are read, that is why the fading dip will cause problems in the neighboring components in a row.
