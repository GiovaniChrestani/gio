    "# Additive White Gaussian Noise, AWGN\n",
    "\n",
    "In this (last) assignment an AWGN channel and a simple equalizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The channel\n",
    "As usual [Wikipedia (AWGN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_white_Gaussian_noise) is a good resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment we will be working on complex base-band symbols.\n",
    "Let x(k) be the transmitted (QPSK) symbol at time k, and n(k) be i.i.d. Complex Gaussian noise, then the recieved signal is:\n",
    "$$ y(k) = x(k) + n(k)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The noise is is distributed as $$ n \\sim \\mathcal{CN}(0, \\sigma^2).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "By changing the value of the variance we can increase or decrease the noise which affect the bit errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ n \\sim \\mathcal{CN}(0, \\sigma^2) \\iff \\Re(n) \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2/2), \\quad \\Im(n) \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2/2)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Channel estimation\n",
    "By transmitting known data, called pilots, the receiver can estimate the channel. The receiver can then equlize the channel by e.g. zero-forcing. In this assignment the pilots are just arbitrarily chosen. In a real system they are usually constructed to obtain some desirable properties to be able to e.g., detect the beginning of a transmission and to detect/correct carrier frequency offsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pilot will be:\n",
    "$$p = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1].$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Each transmission starts by transmitting 4 pilots. Then the data is transmitted. The maximum length of the data is 4096 bits. Then, another 4 pilots are transmitted again, followed by more data.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ x = [p, p, p, p, \\text{4096 data bits}, p, p, p, p, ....].$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Putting it all together\n",
    "Now we have all the building blocks for a simple wireless communication link (in base-band). \n",
    "In previous assignments the following have been implemented:\n",
    "- The Hamming(7,4) channel encoder/decoder\n",
    "- A simple block interleaver/de-interleaver, with depth D\n",
    "- QPSK symbol mapping\n",
    "\n",
    "So in the end the data will go through the following steps, from transmitter to receiver:\n",
    "\n",
    " - TX: Data bits -> Channel coder -> Interleaver -> Symbol mapping -> \n",
    " - Channel: AWGN -> \n",
    " - RX: Equalizer -> Symbol de-mapping -> De-interleaver -> Channel decoder -> Data bits\n",
    " \n",
    "## Assignment\n",
    "1. Implemenet the AWGN channel model\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def awgn_channel(symbols):\n",
    "        noise = # complex gaussian noise\n",
    "        return  symbols + noise\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. **(Optional)** Implement the channel estimation and equalization (there is a lot of inspiration from the [OFDM example](https://dspillustrations.com/pages/posts/misc/python-ofdm-example.html))\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def equlizer(symbols):\n",
    "        rx_pilots =  # Get the pilots from symbols\n",
    "        H_est = # Estimate the channel\n",
    "        # Make some interpolations\n",
    "        # Then equalize\n",
    "        return  symbols / H_est # Equlized symbols\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. Implement the whole communication link above. We have all the parts, now it should be stitched together.\n",
    " \n",
    "Test the link by transmitting a sequence of bits generated by the following command: `data = np.random.randint(0, 2, 2**14)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Show what happens when you add noise. You will start to get bit-errors.\n",
    "5. Compare the system with an uncoded system (no Hamming and no Interleaver; just data -> QPSK).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of a program structure:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "data = np.random.randint(0, 2, 2**14)\n",
    "\n",
    "coded_data = channel_encode(data)\n",
    "inteleaved_data = interleave(coded_data)\n",
    "tx_symbols = qpsk_mapping(inteleaved_data)\n",
    "\n",
    "rx_symbols = awgn_channel(qpsk_tx_symbols)\n",
    "\n",
    "rx_symbols = equalizer(rx_symbols)  # Optional\n",
    "rx_interleaved_data = qpsk_demapping(rx_symbols)\n",
    "rx_coded_data = deinterleave(rx_interleaved_data)\n",
    "rx_data = channel_decode(rx_coded_data)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Are there any bit-errors?\n",
    "np.sum(data == rx_data)\n",
